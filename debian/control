Description: A mixer for system tray
 PNMixer is a simple mixer application designed to run in your system tray. It integrates nicely into desktop environments that don't have a panel that supports applets, and therefore can't run a mixer applet. In particular it's been used quite a lot with fbpanel and tint2, but should run fine in any system tray.
 .
 PNMixer is a fork of OBMixer with a number of additions. These include:
 .
  * Volume adjustment with the scroll wheel
  * Select which ALSA device and channel to use
  * Detect disconnect from sound system and re-connect if requested
  * Bind and use HotKeys for volume control
  * Texual display of volume level in popup window
  * Continous volume adjustment when dragging the slider (not just when you let go)
  * Draw a volume level onto system tray icon
  * Use system icon theme for icons and use mute/low/medium/high volume icons
  * Configurable middle click action
  * Preferences for:
  - volume text display
  - volume text position
  - icon theme
  - amount to adjust per scoll
  - middle click action
  - drawing of volume level on tray icon
 .
